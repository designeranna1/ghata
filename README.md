🍯 **ghata** is a storage 🔌 adapter that takes your uploaded images, videos, or any assets and uploads them to a 🌊 Digital Ocean Space.
By having these assets in a Digital Ocean Space and not having your server to serve these static assets, majority of the load can be transferred to the CDN offered by Digital Ocean Spaces which makes your Ghost blog load faster.
